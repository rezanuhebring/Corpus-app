![Corpus Logo](https://placehold.co/600x300/4F46E5/FFFFFF?text=Corpus&font=raleway)
*(Replace the placeholder image with a real logo)*

**Corpus is a powerful, self-hosted document management and classification system designed for legal, corporate, and research environments. It automatically ingests documents from various sources, uses AI to classify and tag them, and provides a modern, fast, and secure web interface for searching and managing your entire document library.**

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **üíª Multi-Source Ingestion:** A lightweight agent collects documents from local folders, server drives, and Microsoft OneDrive.
*   **üß† Smart Categorization:** Automatically detects language (English, Bahasa) and categorizes documents using a built-in legal dictionary and trainable Machine Learning models.
*   **üóÇÔ∏è Best-Practice Compliance:** Enforces legal best-practice file structures (Client-Matter model) and can automatically rename files to a standardized format on the server.
*   **‚ö° Blazing-Fast Search:** Powered by Elasticsearch, allowing instant full-text search across millions of documents, filenames, metadata, and authors.
*   **üîê Secure & Role-Based:** User and Admin roles with secure JWT authentication. Access to documents is controlled and logged.
*   **üåê Modern Web Dashboard:** A clean, professional, and responsive dashboard built with React for managing, viewing, and analyzing your documents. Includes statistics and data visualizations.
*   **üöÄ Easy Deployment:** Fully containerized with Docker and Docker Compose. A simple `setup.sh` script handles installation and configuration for both development and production environments.
*   **üîí Automated HTTPS:** Production deployments use Nginx as a reverse proxy with free, auto-renewing SSL/TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Corpus is built on a modern microservices architecture, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

*(Replace with a real architecture diagram)*

*   **Corpus-Agent:** A Python-based agent that monitors file systems and sends new/modified documents.
*   **Corpus-API (Backend):** A FastAPI (Python) application that handles ingestion, processing, classification, and serves data to the dashboard.
*   **Corpus-Dashboard (Frontend):** A React.js single-page application that provides the user interface.
*   **Database:** Elasticsearch for powerful full-text search and document storage.
*   **Reverse Proxy:** Nginx for routing traffic and handling SSL/TLS.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A server or VM running a modern Linux distribution (Ubuntu LTS recommended).
*   **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.
*   Git (to clone the repository).
*   For production: A registered domain name pointing to your server's public IP address.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/corpus-app.git
    cd corpus-app
    ```

2.  **Make the installer executable:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ```

3.  **Run the interactive installer:**
    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```
    The script will guide you through selecting either a **Development (HTTP)** or **Production (HTTPS)** setup. For production, you will be prompted for your domain name and email address.

4.  **Wait for the process to complete.** The script will configure everything, build the Docker images, and start all the services.

### Accessing the Application

*   **Development Mode:** `http://localhost:8080` (or your server's IP address if not local).
*   **Production Mode:** `https://your-domain-name.com`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage & Configuration

### Environment Variables

All configuration is managed in the `.env` file, which is created by the `setup.sh` script from `.env.template`. Key variables include:

*   `SECRET_KEY`: A randomly generated key for securing user sessions.
*   `ELASTICSEARCH_HOST`: The internal hostname for the Elasticsearch service.
*   `CORPUS_DOMAIN`: Your public domain name (production only).
*   `CERTBOT_EMAIL`: Your email for Let's Encrypt notifications (production only).

### Managing Services

You can manage the running containers using standard Docker Compose commands from the `corpus-app` directory:

*   **Stop all services:** `docker-compose down`
*   **Start all services:** `docker-compose up -d`
*   **View logs for a specific service:** `docker-compose logs -f backend`
